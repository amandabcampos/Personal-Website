				<h3>Hometown</h3>
				<p> A proud and longing northern Brazilian. Amanda is from the Amazonian region, more specificaly from Belem, Para. No, that is not close to Rio de Janeiro or Sao Paulo. Amanda was born and raised in the region, just like all generations anyone in her family can remember. She grew up eating fresh fish with acai (yes, that is where it's from) and dancing carimbo. So far, it has been very hard for her to relate to people in America, because nobody knows what these words mean. </p>
